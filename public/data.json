Policy\n\n### What it is / Why it matters\n\nThis section details the core principles and requirements for how changes to the organization's `Information Resources` must be managed. It ensures that all changes are handled systematically, from initiation to closure, to maintain system integrity, minimize disruption, and support business objectives.\n\n### 5.1 Preamble\n\nChanges to `information resources` shall be managed and executed according to a **formal change control process**. This process ensures that proposed changes are reviewed, authorized, tested, implemented, and released in a controlled manner, and that the status of each proposed change is continuously monitored. Adherence to this policy is mandatory.\n\n### 5.1.2 Operational Procedures\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nDocumented operational procedures provide a standardized, repeatable way to manage changes. This consistency reduces human error, ensures accountability, and makes the process auditable, which is vital for quality assurance and compliance.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nThe change control process shall be formally defined and documented. A robust change control process must be in place to manage changes to all critical company `information resources` (e.g., hardware, software, system documentation, operating procedures). This documented process shall include management responsibilities and detailed procedures. Where practicable, operational and application change control procedures should be integrated.\n\nAt a minimum, the change control process should include the following phases:\n\n*   Logged Change Requests\n*   Identification, prioritization, and initiation of change\n*   Proper authorization of change\n*   Requirements analysis\n*   Inter-dependency and compliance analysis\n*   Impact Assessment\n*   Change approach\n*   Change testing\n*   User acceptance testing and approval\n*   Implementation and release planning\n*   Documentation\n*   Change monitoring\n*   Defined responsibilities and authorities of all users and IT personnel\n*   Emergency change classification parameters\n\n### 5.1.3 Documented Change\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nComprehensive documentation of all change requests, approvals, and outcomes creates an `audit trail` that is essential for accountability, troubleshooting, historical analysis, and compliance. It prevents unauthorized changes and ensures transparency in the change management process.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nAll change requests, whether approved or rejected, shall be logged on a standardized and central system. The approval of all change requests and their results shall be documented.\n\nA documented `audit trail`, maintained at a Business Unit Level, containing relevant information shall be maintained at all times. This should include change request documentation, change authorization, and the outcome of the change. **No single person should be able to effect changes to production information systems without the approval of other authorized personnel.**\n\n### 5.1.4 Risk Management\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nIntegrating risk assessment into the change process ensures that potential negative consequences are identified and evaluated *before* a change is implemented. This proactive approach allows for informed decision-making and the development of mitigation strategies, thereby minimizing disruption and protecting `Information Resources`.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nA risk assessment shall be performed for all changes. Dependent on the outcome of the risk assessment, an `impact assessment` should be performed.\n\nThe `impact assessment` shall include the potential effect on other `information resources` and potential cost implications. Where applicable, the `impact assessment` should also consider compliance with legislative requirements and standards.\n\n### 5.1.5 Change Classification\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nClassifying changes based on criteria like benefits, urgency, effort, and impact helps prioritize resources effectively and ensures that appropriate levels of review, approval, and testing are applied. This prevents minor changes from being over-processed and critical changes from being rushed.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nAll change requests shall be prioritized in terms of benefits, urgency, effort required, and potential impact on operations.\n\n### 5.1.6 Testing\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nThorough testing in a controlled environment is critical to validate that changes function as intended and do not introduce new issues or vulnerabilities. It identifies potential problems *before* they affect live production systems, protecting business processes, assessing operational and security impacts, and verifying the integrity of the changes.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nChanges shall be tested in an isolated, controlled, and representative environment (where such an environment is feasible) prior to implementation. This is to minimize the effect on the relevant business process, to assess its impact on operations and security, and to verify that only intended and approved changes were made. (For more information, see *System Development Life Cycle* [citation here]).\n\n### 5.1.7 Changes Affecting SLAs\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nConsidering the impact of changes on existing `Service Level Agreements (SLAs)` is vital for maintaining service quality and contractual obligations. This ensures that any changes to service delivery are formally managed, communicated, and, if necessary, renegotiated to avoid penalties or customer dissatisfaction.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nThe impact of change on existing `SLA`s shall be considered. Where applicable, changes to the `SLA` shall be controlled through a formal change process which includes contractual amendments.\n\n### 5.1.8 Version Control\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nImplementing version control for software changes and updates provides a complete history of modifications, enables easy rollback to previous stable versions, and supports auditing and compliance. Retaining older versions according to retention policies is crucial for disaster recovery and historical records.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nAny software change and/or update shall be controlled with `version control`. Older versions shall be retained in accordance with corporate retention and storage management policies. (For more information, see *System Development Life Cycle* [citation here]).\n\n### 5.1.9 Approval\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nFormal approval of changes based on defined criteria (e.g., authorization, impact assessment, testing) ensures that only well-vetted and justified changes proceed to implementation. This multi-level approval process adds a layer of scrutiny and accountability, reducing the risk of unauthorized or poorly conceived changes.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nAll changes shall be approved prior to implementation. Approval of changes shall be based on formal acceptance criteria, including: the change request was done by an authorized user, the `impact assessment` was performed, and proposed changes were tested.\n\n### 5.1.10 Communicating Changes\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nEffective communication ensures that all users significantly affected by a change are aware of it *before* implementation. This transparency reduces resistance, manages expectations, and allows users to provide valuable feedback, fostering a collaborative change process.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nAll users significantly affected by a change shall be notified of the change. The user representative shall sign-off on the change. Users shall be required to make submissions and comment prior to the acceptance of the change.\n\n### 5.1.11 Implementation\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nControlled implementation, following thorough testing and stakeholder approval, minimizes disruption and ensures successful deployment. Treating major changes as projects provides a structured approach, allowing for proper planning, resource allocation, and risk management, which is critical for complex or high-impact deployments.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nImplementation will only be undertaken after appropriate testing and approval by stakeholders. All major changes shall be treated as new system implementation and shall be established as a project. Major changes will be classified according to the effort required to develop and implement said changes. (For more information, see *System Development Life Cycle* [citation here]).\n\n### 5.1.12 Fallback\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nHaving clearly documented `fallback` (or `rollback`) procedures is essential for mitigating the risks associated with unsuccessful change implementations. This ensures that systems can be quickly restored to a stable state, minimizing downtime and business impact in case of unforeseen issues.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nProcedures for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes shall be documented. Should the outcome of a change be different from the expected result (as identified in the testing of the change), procedures and responsibilities shall be noted for the recovery and continuity of the affected areas. `Fallback` procedures will be in place to ensure systems can revert back to what they were prior to implementation of changes.\n\n### 5.1.13 Documentation\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nUpdating `Information Resources` documentation after every change is critical for maintaining accurate records, supporting future development, and facilitating knowledge transfer. Complete and up-to-date documentation is foundational for ongoing operations, troubleshooting, and compliance.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\n`Information resources` documentation shall be updated on the completion of each change, and old documentation shall be archived or disposed of as per the documentation and data retention policies.\n\n`Information resources` documentation is used for reference purposes in various scenarios, such as further development of existing `information resources` and ensuring adequate knowledge transfer in the event of the original developer and/or development house being unavailable. It is therefore imperative that `information resources` documentation is complete, accurate, and kept up-to-date with the latest changes. Policies and procedures, affected by software changes, shall be updated on completion of each change.\n\n### 5.1.14 Business Continuity Plans (BCP)\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nEnsuring `Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)` are updated with relevant changes is crucial for the organization's resilience. BCPs serve as roadmaps for minimizing disruption and facilitating rapid recovery during disasters, and they must accurately reflect the current state of `Information Resources` to be effective.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\n`Business continuity plans` shall be updated with relevant changes, managed through the change control process. `Business continuity plans` rely on the completeness, accuracy, and availability of BCP documentation. BCP documentation is the roadmap used to minimize disruption to critical business processes where possible, and to facilitate their rapid recovery in the event of disasters.\n\n### 5.1.15 Emergency Changes\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nEstablishing specific procedures for `emergency changes` acknowledges that some situations require immediate action outside of the standard change process. However, these procedures ensure that even urgent changes are controlled, authorized, and documented to minimize risks and maintain accountability.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nSpecific procedures to ensure the proper control, authorization, and documentation of `emergency changes` shall be in place. Specific parameters will be defined as a standard for classifying changes as `Emergency changes`.\n\n### 5.1.16 Change Monitoring\n\n#### What it is / Why it matters\n\nMonitoring changes post-implementation is essential for verifying their effectiveness, identifying any unintended consequences, and ensuring that they perform as expected in the production environment. This feedback loop allows for immediate action on deviations and continuous improvement of the change management process.\n\n#### Policy Statement\n\nAll changes will be monitored once they have been rolled out to the production environment. Deviations from design specifications and test results will be documented and escalated to the solution owner for ratification.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Roles and Responsibilities\n\n### What it is / Why it matters\n\nClearly defined roles and responsibilities are fundamental to a successful change management framework. They ensure accountability, prevent duplication of effort, and clarify who is responsible for each aspect of the change process, from strategic oversight to day-to-day implementation and

                "This cheatsheet is definitely not \"complete\". I am sure i forgot to write down hundreds of essential commands, used most of them in the wrong way with unnessecary flags and you'll  probably soon ask yourself how i've even made it through the exam. Also you might think a certain tool used should be in another phase of the attack (e.g certain nmap vulnerabitly scripts should be in Exploitation). That's okay, imho the edges between different stages of a penetration test are very blurry. Feel free to issue a PR if you want to help to improve the list.\n*There are a number of tools you are not allowed to use during your OSCP exam. At the time of writing, sqlmap is one of them. Check which tools are restricted/banned before you use them in your exam. You can find detailed information about tool usage in the exam guidelines.*\n**Use for educational purposes only!**"
