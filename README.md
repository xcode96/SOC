# Interactive Guide Builder

This is a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) that provides a comprehensive, interactive guide on various technical topics. It features a rich user interface for browsing content and a powerful, password-protected admin panel for content management, user administration, and data synchronization with GitHub.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Guides**: Easily navigate and search through different topics within multiple guides.
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Select any concept to get a detailed explanation generated by the Google Gemini API, with modes for both beginners and experts.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Content is structured in a JSON-like format and rendered into beautiful, readable components, including support for code blocks, tables, highlights, and more.
- **Full-Featured Admin Panel**: A secure area for administrators to manage all aspects of the application content.
- **Guide & Card Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) the guide cards displayed on the homepage.
- **Topic Management**: Full CRUD capabilities for topics within each guide.
- **Rich Markdown Editor**: A user-friendly Markdown editor with a live preview and toolbar for easy content creation.
- **Admin User Management**: Add and delete admin users directly from the dashboard.
- **Data Persistence**: All content and user data are saved in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence.
- **GitHub Sync**: Publish all local data to a `data.json` file in a specified GitHub repository, serving as a backup or a method for deploying updated content.

## 📁 File Structure

The project is organized into several key directories to separate concerns like components, pages, data, and layouts.

## ⚙️ How It Works: Data Management

The application has a layered approach to data management to ensure robustness and flexibility.

1.  **Initial Load**: On first launch, the app attempts to fetch `/public/data.json`.
2.  **Hardcoded Fallback**: If `data.json` is not found or is invalid, the application falls back to using the hardcoded guide data located in the `/data` directory.
3.  **LocalStorage Hydration**: This default data (from either `data.json` or the hardcoded files) is used to populate the browser's `localStorage` if no data is already present.
4.  **Primary Data Source**: Once initialized, `localStorage` becomes the single source of truth. All changes made in the admin panel (editing guides, adding topics, etc.) are saved directly to `localStorage`.
5.  **GitHub Publishing**: The "Publish to GitHub" feature allows an administrator to push the current state of the `localStorage` data (all guides, cards, and users) to their own GitHub repository. This overwrites the `data.json` file there, acting as a powerful backup and content deployment mechanism.
